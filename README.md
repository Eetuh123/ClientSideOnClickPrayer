# Instant Client-Side Overhead
A RuneLite plugin that displays a fake overhead prayer icon instantly when you click a protection prayer, instead of waiting for the server to update on the next tick.

## Why?

In OSRS, when you activate a protection prayer, the server registers it instantly if clicked before the next tickâ€™s damage calculation.
However, the overhead icon only appears at the start of the following tick.
This plugin makes the icon appear immediately on your client so you can visually confirm your flick timing without that 1-tick delay.
